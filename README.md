#Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

Problem Definition:

The problem at hand involves developing an earthquake prediction model utilizing a Kaggle dataset. The primary objective encompasses exploring and comprehending the vital features of earthquake data, creating a global overview through data visualization on a world map, dividing the data for both training and testing purposes, and constructing a neural network model for predicting earthquake magnitudes based on the provided features.

Design Thinking:

Data Source Selection:

Task: Choose an appropriate Kaggle dataset containing earthquake data.
Action: Explore various datasets available on Kaggle, focusing on datasets with relevant features such as date, time, latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude. Select a dataset that is comprehensive and well-maintained.

Feature Exploration:

Task: Analyze and understand the distribution, correlations, and characteristics of key features.
Action: Utilize statistical methods and visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices) to gain insights into the data. Understand how the features relate to each other and identify potential patterns.

Visualization:

Task: Create a world map visualization to display earthquake frequency distribution.
Action: Utilize geospatial visualization libraries (such as Folium in Python) to plot earthquake data points on a world map. Use colors, sizes, or heatmaps to represent earthquake magnitudes. This visualization will provide a clear global overview of earthquake occurrences.

Data Splitting:

Task: Split the dataset into a training set and a test set for model validation.
Action: Use established techniques like random splitting or time-based splitting, depending on the dataset's characteristics. Aim for a balance that ensures the model is trained on diverse data and evaluated on unseen data.

Model Development:

Task: Build a neural network model for earthquake magnitude prediction.
Action: Design a neural network architecture suitable for regression tasks. Experiment with different layers, activation functions, and optimizers. Normalize or scale the input features as necessary. Monitor the model's complexity to prevent overfitting.

Training and Evaluation:

Task: Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.
Action: Train the neural network using the training data, adjusting hyperparameters if required. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set, utilizing metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) to quantify prediction accuracy. Iterate on the model and data preprocessing steps to enhance performance
